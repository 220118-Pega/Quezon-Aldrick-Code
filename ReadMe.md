# About me

### Hi my name is Aldrick

I was born in the Philippines and moved to Florida at age 10.

I'm making the career switch from Pharmacy because I realized I like Web Development early this year and now here I am!

I play guitar, tennis, and a lot of videogames.

Very excited with this career change and looking forward to what I can do with the different languages!
